        <div class="box-1" style="background-color: rgb(58, 187, 64);" ><p>When you apply a CSS property to an element, there’s lots of things going on under the hood. For example, let’s say we have some HTML like this:</p></div>
        <div class="box-2" style="background-color: tomato;" ><p>That flex property above is what’s known as a shorthand CSS property. And really what this is doing is setting three separate CSS properties at the same time. So what we wrote above is the same as writing this:</p></div>
        <div class="box-3" style="background-color: lightseagreen;" ><p>Also, the default styles are a good thing because we don’t need to know what these flexbox properties are doing 90% of the time. For example, when I use flexbox, I tend to write something like this:</p></div>
        <div class="box-4" style="background-color: rgb(236, 189, 35);" ><p>I try to avoid shorthand properties because they can get pretty confusing and I often tend to write the long hand versions just because my brain fails to parse long lines of property values. But it’s recommended to use the shorthand when it comes to flexbox, which is…weird… that is, until you understand that the flex property is doing a lot of work and each of its sub-properties interact with the others.</p></div>
